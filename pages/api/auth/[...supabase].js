import { handleAuth } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'

export default handleAuth({ logout: { returnTo: '/' } })

/*
Executing handleAuth() creates the following route handlers under the hood that perform different parts of the authentication flow:

/api/auth/callback: The UserProvider forwards the session details here every time onAuthStateChange fires on the client side. This is needed to set up the cookies for your application so that SSR works seamlessly.

/api/auth/user: You can fetch user profile information in JSON format.

/api/auth/logout: Your Next.js application logs out the user. You can optionally pass a returnTo parameter to return to a custom relative URL after logout, eg /api/auth/logout?returnTo=/login. This will overwrite the logout returnTo option specified handleAuth()
